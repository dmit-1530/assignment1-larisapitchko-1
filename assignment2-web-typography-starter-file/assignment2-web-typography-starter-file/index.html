    <h2>1. Peace after Turbulence — Hexagram 11 〈泰〉</h2>
    <p>When the storms subside and the dust settles, the world feels fragile again—quiet, uncertain, and strangely bright. 
    This is not the silence of defeat but the pause of healing. The old structures that once rattled with conflict now 
    stand still, waiting for new life to move through them. In this moment of balance, every gesture matters: the way 
    you speak, the way you rest, the way you rebuild your rhythm after long disruption.</p>

    <p>Harmony is not born from stillness alone; it grows through the patient weaving of opposites. Earth meets Heaven, 
    action meets rest, and the heart rediscovers its natural beat. Those who learn to breathe with the rhythm of calm 
    weather carry its strength even when storms return.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Choose steady habits over dramatic gestures; let stability compound.</p>

    <h2>2. The Obstacle Becomes the Path — Hexagram 39 〈蹇〉</h2>
    <p>Mountains block the way, rivers overflow, plans unravel. At first the heart tightens with frustration—why this 
    delay, why this turn? Yet over time the obstacle begins to speak. It points toward humility, ingenuity, and the 
    courage to move differently. When the familiar road disappears, you must feel your way forward with patience and 
    faith.</p>

    <p>Every difficulty conceals a direction. If you listen closely enough, you can hear where the current wishes to 
    carry you. Sometimes the slowest detour brings you to the truest destination.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Reframe resistance as guidance; adapt your method, not your mission.</p>

    <h2>3. Quiet Waiting — Hexagram 5 〈需〉</h2>
    <p>Before the harvest comes the season of preparation. The ground must soften, the sky must open, and the mind must 
    learn to trust invisible timing. Waiting is not idleness—it is participation in the unseen motion of events. The 
    wise prepare tools, nourish the body, and keep the heart still while forces align beyond control.</p>

    <p>When action finally calls, you will move with precision instead of impulse. The energy saved in patience becomes 
    clarity in motion. This is the art of timing known to water, moonlight, and all who thrive without hurry.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Read the weather of the moment; readiness is progress.</p>

    <h2>4. The Turning Point — Hexagram 24 〈復〉</h2>
    <p>The cycle nears completion, yet something essential returns. After a long wandering, the traveler remembers the 
    first intention—the spark that began the journey. Renewal does not require grand reinvention; it begins with one 
    sincere correction, one return to truth. Like the solstice light creeping back after longest night, small changes 
    restore balance before the world even notices.</p>

    <p>Listen for beginnings disguised as endings. The rhythm of revival is gentle but unstoppable.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Start small, start true; renewal begins beneath the surface.</p>

    <h2>5. Harmony and Balance — Hexagram 61 〈中孚〉</h2>
    <p>Integrity is the hidden architecture of peace. When intention, word, and deed align, conflict dissolves without 
    struggle. Trust is not demanded; it arises naturally, like fragrance from a flower. Balance lives not in perfect 
    symmetry but in constant conversation between forces—a quiet give and take.</p>

    <p>Those who cultivate sincerity in small moments create harmony on large scales. Within such people, even silence 
    feels trustworthy.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Align intent and expression; integrity is the quiet architecture of harmony.</p>

    <h2>6. Clarity from Confusion — Hexagram 64 〈未濟〉</h2>
    <p>The journey nears completion but the bridge is still half-built. Mist blurs the shore, tasks multiply, and haste 
    tempts the hand to finish carelessly. Yet wisdom pauses here, at the edge between almost and complete. Clarity comes 
    not from rushing ahead but from refining each remaining step.</p>

    <p>Re-examine details. Return to alignment. When the fog lifts, the path will already be beneath your feet, laid by 
    the patience you practiced in uncertainty.</p>

    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Finish with focus; small corrections prevent large regrets.</p>
